# Watson

"It's elementary, my dear Watson." - Sherlock Holmes ([but not actually](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2016/07/14/watson/))

Welcome to my centralized repository for my learning materials.

## Goal

Ensuring my learning materials stay organized has been a long-standing challenge. Often, after working through tutorials, textbooks, or workshops, their resources would end up buried within folders on my computer, scattered and forgotten. These folders would find themselves tucked away in illogical locations, only to resurface during sporadic cleanup sessions, where, sadly, I'd often delete them out of frustration.

This lack of centralization and order meant I rarely revisited these valuable materials. Enter the Watson repository: a dedicated space designed to remedy this chaos. Here, every resource finds its designated place. This repository evolves alongside my studies, accumulating knowledge while offering a single, accessible location for all my learning needs.

With the Watson repository, I no longer lose track of valuable resources. It's the go-to hub where I can easily search and retrieve information whenever the need arises during my learning journey.

## Contents
