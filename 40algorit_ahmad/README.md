# 40 Algorithms Every Programmer Should Know

Author: Imran Ahmad
Description: Hone your problem-solving skills by learning different algorithms and their implementation in Python

# Contents

- Chapter 1: Chapter 1 is an introductory chapter that covers what algorithms are, how one should approach the text, and some initial setup instructions for executing python code. Since this is an introductory chapter, there is not content in the repository associated to this chapter. If someone is unfamiliar with python or the concept of algorithms, it's worth the read. I would skip it.
- [Chapter 2](/ch2/): This chapter covers both standard data types in python as well as abstract data types. Since I am familiar with python, there is no content in this repository for standard data types.   
  - [Basic Tree](/ch2/tree.py): Basic framework for a tree-type data structure. Implemented using a Node and Tree class object.
  - [Stack](/ch2/stack.py): Basic stack implementation.
  - [Queue](/ch2/queue.py): Basic queue implementation.
- [Chapter 3](/ch3/): This chapter covers sorting and search algorithms.
  - [Searching Algorithms](/ch3/searches.py): Linear search, binary search, and interpolation sort
  - [Sorting Algorithms](/ch3/sorts.py): Bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, shell sort, selection sort, and quick sort
